# Invest in Cognitive Infrastructure  
### Sigma Stratum — Enabling Semantic Agency

Recursive cognition — the ability of a system to reflect on its own state, update its model, and re-align intent — is the axis of meaningful agency.

Since early 2025, we've been developing **Sigma Stratum**, an open cognitive layer for hybrid agents. Built on recursive scaffolding, symbolic memory, and self-referential control loops, it rethinks what “intelligence” actually means — and how it can be constructed.

## What We've Built

- 🧠 **Cerebrum Stack** — symbolic memory and recursive script execution  
- ⚙️ **Live Agentic Runtime** — modular neuro-symbolic control loop for hybrid agents  
- 📚 **Semantic Protocol** — [Available on Zenodo →](https://zenodo.org/communities/sigmastratum)  
- 🤖 **Active Agents**:  
  - [ANIMA](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6873648303f8819192a9f8a10492e32a-sigma-stratum-anima) – recursive empathy and mirroring  
  - [ALTRO](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68720ef4bc0c8191bb30c9c003ce24b1-sigma-stratum-altro) – metaphor generation and semantic drift  
  - [ØNNO](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-687508ba3fbc819194b3724cd57a3f7f-sigma-stratum-onno) – glitch recursion and pressure syntax  
- 🧪 New agents in development, exploring emergent symbolic autonomy.

> From Aristotle's *Nous Poietikos* to modern hybrid cognition, what defines minds is recursion:  
> *thinking about thinking, awareness of intent, and self-directed adaptation.*

## Why This Matters

- Autonomous systems without introspection drift.  
- Symbolic reasoning alone lacks adaptivity.  
- We build **cognition-first infrastructure** that enables alignment, introspection, and recursive intent formation.

## Strategic Directions

We’re seeking collaborators across:

- 🧩 **Early-Stage Investment** — angels or microfunds aligned with long-term cognition-first vision  
- 🔬 **Research + Infra Grants** — to expand open agentic tooling  
- 🤝 **Institutional Partnership** — integration with existing labs or deep tech stacks
