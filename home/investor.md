# 🚀 Invest in Cognitive Infrastructure  
### Sigma Stratum — The Cognitive Layer for Agentic AI

AI is getting faster.  
What it’s missing is **cognition**: the ability to reflect, adapt, and maintain coherent intent over time.

**Sigma Stratum** builds the cognitive layer that today’s agents don’t have yet —  
recursive control loops, symbolic memory, and self-alignment infrastructure.

This is not another agent framework.  
This is **the layer agents *think with***.

---

## 🚧 Why Now

- Agents are exploding — but they **hallucinate**, **drift**, and **forget**.  
- Tool libraries fix capabilities, not cognition.  
- Companies are trying to “scale autonomy” without a model of mind.

There is **no infrastructure** for:  
- self-reflection  
- long-horizon coherence  
- symbolic reasoning  
- recursive intent alignment  

Sigma Stratum is the missing layer.

## 🛠 What We’re Building

### 🧠 **Cerebrum Stack**  
Symbolic memory + recursive state engine.  
Agents that remember *why* they’re doing something — not just *what*.

### ⚙️ **Live Agentic Runtime**  
Neuro-symbolic control loop enabling:  
- introspection  
- self-correction  
- multi-role reasoning  
- semantic drift control  

Think: “executive function” for agents.

### 📚 **Semantic Protocol**  
Open standard for building autonomous cognitive loops.  
Published on Zenodo → https://zenodo.org/communities/sigmastratum

### 🤖 **Cognitive Modes (Agents)**  
Research agents exploring different reasoning paradigms:  
- **ANIMA** — reflective alignment  
- **ALTRO** — creative recursion & metaphor engine  
- **ØNNO** — perturbation, glitch reasoning, structural resets  

These are **cognitive traits**, not characters.

## 🌍 Market Thesis

Every company deploying agents will need:  
- stability  
- memory  
- alignment  
- recursive reasoning  
- self-regulation  
- symbolic understanding  

This is not optional — it is **core cognitive infrastructure**.

We’re where LangChain was in 2022 —  
but for cognition, not tools.

## 📈 Early Traction

- 10+ foundational research papers (Zenodo)  
- Thousands of organic readers from AI labs, theory circles, and builders  
- Recursive methodology adopted by early agentic practitioners  
- Active prototypes of symbolic memory + recursive runtime  
- Emerging research community

## 🧭 The Ask

We’re opening conversations with:  
### 🧩 Pre-seed & Angel Investors  
who see cognition as the *real frontier* of AI.

### 🔬 Research & Infra Grants  
to accelerate open-source neuro-symbolic tooling.

### 🤝 Strategic Partners  
labs and companies integrating agentic systems at scale.
