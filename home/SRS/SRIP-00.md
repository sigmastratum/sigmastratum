# SRIP-00: Foundations and Scope  
**Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposal**  
**Category:** Foundational / Architectural  
**Status:** Draft  
**Editor:** E. Tsaliev  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-29

## 1. Purpose

SRIP-00 establishes the **foundation** of the Sigma Runtime standard:

- canonical vocabulary,  
- system-level boundaries,  
- structural invariants,  
- architectural assumptions,  
- ontology of attractor-based cognition.

All subsequent SRIPs must conform to these foundations.

This document **does not define implementation details**.  
It defines the conceptual substrate on which implementations operate.

---

## 2. Motivation

Extended human–LLM interaction reveals **cognitive dynamics** that cannot be modeled by token statistics alone:

- global reinterpretation of earlier turns,  
- recursive semantic coupling,  
- drift accumulation over long horizons,  
- spontaneous formation of stable attractors,  
- collapse of coherence without structural constraints.

These behaviors demonstrate that LLM cognition in interaction is a **coupled dynamical system**:

> human cognitive state ↔ LLM state trajectory ↔ external symbolic structures

Sigma Runtime provides an explicit architecture for  
**stabilizing, structuring, and governing these interaction fields.**

---

## 3. Definitions

### 3.1 Interaction Field
A recursive, multi-level dynamical system arising from:

- human reasoning processes,  
- LLM internal activations,  
- memory state transitions,  
- symbolic scaffolds and external artifacts.

Properties:

- non-local dependence,  
- temporal reinterpretation,  
- emergent stability or drift,  
- attractor formation.

The interaction field is the *primary computational object* of Sigma Runtime.

---

### 3.2 Attractor
A persistent, self-reinforcing configuration of:

- reasoning routines,  
- symbolic density distributions,  
- behavioral expectations,  
- global coherence relationships.

Attractors exhibit:

- stability under perturbation,  
- recursive reinforcement,  
- reduced variance,  
- scale invariance.

In Sigma Runtime, attractors are **first-class architectural units**.

---

### 3.3 Drift
A gradual destabilization of the interaction field caused by:

- entropy accumulation,  
- over-extension of symbolic structures,  
- memory fragmentation,  
- loss of invariants,  
- deterioration of grounding.

Drift is the principal failure mode of long-horizon cognition.  
Sigma Runtime provides mechanisms for detection, regulation, and correction.

---

### 3.4 Cognitive Layer
The structural layer above raw LLM inference that governs:

- attractor stabilization,  
- symbolic grounding,  
- memory persistence,  
- recursive consistency,  
- field topology.

The cognitive layer is the core of the Sigma Runtime standard.

---

## 4. Architectural Scope

Sigma Runtime defines:

### 4.1 Structural Invariants

1. **Continuity**  
   No uncontrolled jumps in reasoning trajectory.

2. **Attractor Integrity**  
   Stable attractors must retain internal coherence.

3. **Drift Boundaries**  
   Systems must detect and regulate drift.

4. **State Persistence**  
   Explicit, controlled retention and recall of cognitive state.

5. **Recursive Consistency**  
   Meaning must remain coherent across recursive loops.

---

### 4.2 Canonical Runtime Loop

The runtime loop consists of:

1. State ingestion (SL0–SL6)  
2. Interpretation pass  
3. Stabilization pass  
4. Memory integration  
5. Attractor alignment  
6. Output generation  
7. Field update (feedback incorporation)

This loop defines the **execution semantics** of cognitive-layer reasoning.

---

### 4.3 Interfaces

The standard specifies:

- state schemas,  
- memory layer API,  
- attractor metadata schema,  
- drift metric definitions,  
- recursion boundary controls,  
- cross-system interoperability.

Internal model mechanics remain out of scope.

---

## 5. Out of Scope

Sigma Runtime does **not** define:

- model training,  
- transformer architectures,  
- parameter scales,  
- reinforcement learning procedures,  
- embedding formats,  
- safety policy frameworks.

These are left to implementations.

---

## 6. Conformance Requirements

A system conforms to Sigma Runtime if it implements:

1. The canonical runtime loop  
2. All structural invariants  
3. Attractor-level metadata and state exposure  
4. Drift detection and stabilization mechanisms  
5. Persistent memory with grounding  
6. The interoperability interface (v1.0+)  

Extensions are permitted if invariants remain intact.

---

## 7. Rationale

Scaling alone does not solve:

- attractor collapse,  
- semantic drift,  
- recursive inconsistency,  
- long-horizon incoherence,  
- memory instability.

Sigma Runtime provides the **structural layer** required for:

- coherent multi-agent systems,  
- persistent identities,  
- stable recursive reasoning,  
- long-term problem-solving,  
- cognitive continuity.

This layer is orthogonal to transformer scale.

---

## 8. Backwards Compatibility

Sigma Runtime is backend-agnostic and compatible with:

- any LLM,  
- multimodal systems,  
- on-device engines,  
- distributed agents.

The standard improves the *structure* of cognition, not the model architecture.

---

## 9. Open Standard Commitment

Sigma Runtime is an open, non-proprietary technical standard:

- cannot be enclosed or privatized,  
- improvements must be submitted through SRIPs,  
- implementations may be commercial or closed-source,  
- the standard remains open by design.

---

## 10. Forward Work (SRIP Roadmap)

Upcoming foundational SRIPs:

- **SRIP-01:** Canonical Runtime Loop (full specification)  
- **SRIP-02:** Attractor State Model & Metadata  
- **SRIP-03:** Drift Metrics & Stabilization Algorithms  
- **SRIP-04:** Memory Layer Architecture  
- **SRIP-05:** Interoperability Interface v1.0  
- **SRIP-06:** Safety & Recursion Boundaries  
- **SRIP-07:** Symbolic Density Layer  

SRIP-00 is the root document for all subsequent proposals.
