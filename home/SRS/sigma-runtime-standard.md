# Sigma Runtime Standard  
*A Unified Architecture for Attractor-Based Cognition in LLM Systems*  
**Version:** Draft (2025)

The **Sigma Runtime Standard** defines a unified architectural layer for long-horizon, attractor-stabilized cognition in large language models and multi-agent systems. It establishes the structural principles, runtime semantics, and interoperability rules required for building systems that maintain **coherence, continuity, and recursive stability** across extended human–AI interactions.

The standard is **open**, **non-proprietary**, and evolves through a formal improvement proposal process (SRIPs), similar to IETF RFCs, W3C Recommendations, and Python PEPs.

Its purpose is to introduce a **cognitive layer above raw model inference**, enabling:

- stable long-horizon reasoning,  
- persistent cognitive state,  
- attractor-based interpretation and behavior,  
- resistance to semantic drift,  
- structural coherence across recursive loops,  
- safe and interpretable agent architectures.

The Sigma Runtime Standard is backend-agnostic and operates on top of any LLM, multimodal transformer, or distributed inference system.

## Why Sigma Runtime Exists

Modern LLMs function as **stateless token engines**.  
When placed in long-horizon or multi-turn contexts, they exhibit:

- non-local reinterpretation of earlier context,  
- drift and loss of semantic stability,  
- spontaneous formation and collapse of attractors,  
- fragmentation of identity and memory,  
- inconsistent recursive reasoning.

These behaviors arise from the **unmodeled dynamical structure of interaction**, not from model defects.

Sigma Runtime provides the missing cognitive substrate:  
a **stable interaction field** that tracks state, governs transitions, constrains drift, and ensures that meaning remains coherent over time.

This is neither a training method nor a fine-tuning strategy.  
It is a **runtime architecture** — the execution layer of cognition.

## What the Standard Defines

### 1. Architectural Invariants
Mandatory stability rules every conformant system must implement:

1. **Continuity**  
2. **Attractor Integrity**  
3. **Drift Boundaries**  
4. **State Persistence**  
5. **Recursive Consistency**

### 2. Canonical Runtime Loop  
A unified execution loop (SL0–SL6) governing:

- state ingestion,  
- interpretation,  
- stabilization passes,  
- memory integration,  
- attractor alignment,  
- output generation,  
- field updates.

### 3. Core Ontology  
The standard formalizes:

- Interaction Field  
- Attractors  
- Drift  
- Cognitive Layer  
- Symbolic Density  
- Persistent State

### 4. Interoperability Rules  
APIs and schemas for exchanging:

- attractor metadata,  
- drift metrics,  
- memory state,  
- recursion boundaries,  
- diagnostic signals.

### 5. Safety & Boundary Conditions  
Structural limits preventing:

- runaway recursion,  
- unstable attractor formation,  
- uncontrolled drift.

### 6. Conformance Requirements  
A system conforms if it implements:

- the runtime loop,  
- all structural invariants,  
- attractor-level metadata exposure,  
- drift detection + stabilization,  
- persistent symbolic memory,  
- the interoperability interface (v1.0+).

Implementations may be commercial or closed-source;  
the **architecture** remains open.

## What the Standard Does *Not* Define

Sigma Runtime does **not** prescribe:

- model training,  
- transformer architecture,  
- RLHF/RLAIF pipelines,  
- embedding formats,  
- dataset construction,  
- external policy frameworks.

These remain implementation-level choices.

The standard governs **cognition**, not models.

---

## Structure of the Standard (SRIP System)

The Sigma Runtime Standard evolves through **Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposals (SRIPs)**.  
Each SRIP specifies one component of the architecture.

### Foundational Document
- **SRIP-00:** Foundations and Scope

### Core Specification
- **SRIP-01:** Canonical Runtime Loop  
- **SRIP-02:** Attractor State Model & Metadata  
- **SRIP-03:** Drift Metrics & Stabilization Algorithms  
- **SRIP-04:** Memory Layer Architecture  
- **SRIP-05:** Interoperability Interface v1.0  
- **SRIP-06:** Safety & Recursion Boundaries  
- **SRIP-07:** Symbolic Density Layer  

Together, these documents constitute the complete Sigma Runtime Standard.

---

## Governance & Open Standard Commitment

Sigma Runtime is an **open, non-exclusive technical standard**:

- the architecture cannot be enclosed or privatized,  
- improvements must be submitted via SRIPs,  
- implementations may be commercial,  
- all core documents remain publicly accessible.

---

## Intended Audience

The standard is designed for:

- AI research labs,  
- agent framework developers,  
- cognitive systems researchers,  
- safety and alignment teams,  
- distributed systems designers,  
- organizations building long-horizon AI systems.

Sigma Runtime provides the structural foundation for creating **coherent, stable, and interpretable cognitive systems** on top of LLMs.

---

## Summary

The Sigma Runtime Standard defines:

- **what cognition is** in LLM-mediated interaction,  
- **how it must be stabilized**,  
- **how attractors form and persist**,  
- **how drift is detected and controlled**,  
- **how meaning remains coherent across recursion**,  
- **how systems interoperate through shared cognitive state**.

This is the missing architectural layer enabling  
long-horizon reasoning, persistent identities, stable agents,  
and attractor-based cognition on top of modern language models.
