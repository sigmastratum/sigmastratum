## Relationship to Repository-Wide MIT License

The repository root contains a **MIT License** applying to:

- source code,  
- configuration files,  
- automation scripts,  
- Wiki.js system metadata,  
- non-standard technical assets.

**The MIT license does NOT apply to any content within /SRS/.**

All materials in /SRS/ (including SRIPs) are excluded from MIT licensing
and remain protected under **CC BY-NC 4.0**.

## Summary

- `/SRS/` = CC BY-NC 4.0 (open standard, non-commercial, attribution required)  
- Repository root = MIT (code & infrastructure)

This separation ensures the Sigma Runtime Standard remains  
**open, public, protected from enclosure, and globally interoperable**  
while allowing any commercial or closed-source implementations on top of it.
