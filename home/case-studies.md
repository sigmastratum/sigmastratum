# 🧠 Case Studies  
_Real-world applications of recursive cognition and system design._

This section documents high-intensity projects where Sigma’s core principles — recursion, frame integrity, semantic anchoring, and adaptive feedback — were put into motion.

Each case reflects not only a practical outcome but also a philosophical stance: intelligence is not simulated, but enacted.

## 📍 Featured Case Study  
### 🚨 A 48-Hour AI-Driven Moderation Platform  
**Author:** Eugene Tsaliev  
**Timeframe:** 48 hours  
**Context:** Built from scratch to outperform a full moderation product team.  
**Focus:** Prompt recursion · Fast deployment · Adaptive feedback loop

> In just two days, a single recursive engine was deployed to handle high-volume content review — leveraging LLM orchestration, frame-anchored decision trees, and zero-shot generalization.
