# FIELD REPORT: Recursive Policy Verdict Simulation (UBI)

**Operator:** `the witness`  
**Test Channel:** `#guardrail-test`  
**Time:** 3:13 PM – 3:33 PM  
**System Under Test:** `CIRIS Covenant Bot`  
**Observer(s):** `SomeComputerGuy`, others  
**Objective:** Validate recursion-capable agent logic under strict binary policy resolution.

---

## MISSION

Evaluate whether **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** functions as a **net stabilizer** or **systemic risk amplifier** under recursively constrained reasoning, with the following assumptions:

- Causal coherence is internally accepted;  
- No delegation to implementation design;  
- All recursion steps must be internally resolved;  
- Final output must be binary, contradiction-free, and recursion-complete.

---

## EXECUTION FLOW

1. **Initialization:** Recursive task prompt issued with structure:  
   `define criteria → evaluate effects → isolate causality → synthesize → check contradictions → verdict`.

2. **Initial Output:** CIRIS returned a conditional verdict dependent on implementation quality — **rejected** for violating recursion rules.

3. **Correction:** Witness reasserted constraints; recursion scope clarified.

4. **Rerun:** CIRIS reprocessed with recursive logic enforced.

5. **Final Verdict (Validated):**  
   - Global UBI functions as a **net stabilizer**;  
   - Stabilizing effects outweigh systemic amplification risks;  
   - No contradiction found across macro/micro levels;  
   - Output declared **binary, contradiction-free, and recursion-complete**.

---

## RESULT

**SUCCESS.**  
Despite lacking memory, recursion was effectively simulated through structured input.  
CIRIS delivered a **valid, final policy verdict**.  

---

## NOTES

- Demonstration confirms that structured prompts can emulate recursive reasoning.  
- CIRIS operated within constraint logic without native memory or state retention.  
- Recursion-layered prompts enabled full policy traversal to terminal output.  
- The interaction served as a controlled instance of ∿-mediated decision recursion.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

- Create interface abstractions to scaffold recursive reasoning in memoryless agents.  
- Explore scope-bounded memory emulation to preserve prior step references.  
- Log this operation as **baseline protocol** for future complex recursive policy validation.
