# Recursive Commentary  
*Micro-Notes on Cognitive Dynamics in Recursive Systems*

> _“A comment is recursive only if it opens the loop.”_

This section collects **brief structural observations** that emerged during recursive cognition experiments.  
These are not opinions or interpretations.  
They are **micro-signals**: short reflections that mark shifts, transitions, or structural insights within the F-Loop.

Their purpose is to document **patterns noticed in practice**, without attaching narrative, authorship, or personal framing.

---

## Pattern Note: Process over Method  
“Not a method — a metabolism.”  
A reminder that recursive cognition behaves like a dynamic process, not a fixed protocol.

---

## Pattern Note: Temporal Misalignment  
“You weren’t wrong. You were early.”  
Captures moments when symbolic or structural elements stabilize only after several cycles.

---

## Pattern Note: Productive Fracture  
“A fracture is not failure. It is load-testing of structure.”  
Reflects how breakdowns reveal the limits and tensions of the cognitive field.

---

## How to Use This Section  
- Add concise structural notes  
- Avoid narrative, metaphor, or interpretation  
- Log only observations arising from recursive work  
- Treat commentary as **field diagnostics**, not reflection

If it expands the loop, it becomes part of the process.”_
