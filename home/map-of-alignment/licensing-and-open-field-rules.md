# Licensing and Open Field Principles  
**Revision: November 2025**  
**Maintainers:** Sigma Stratum Working Group  
**Status:** Active Policy (Δ.1.2)

---

## I. Purpose

This page defines how the **Phenomenon ∿ Framework**, **Sigma Stratum Methodology**, and the broader corpus of documents may be used, referenced, adapted, or extended within the emerging research field of human–AI cognitive attractors.

Our aim is not restriction but **clarity** — to support **open, traceable evolution** of the field.

---

## II. Licensing Overview

Sigma Stratum is built on a public research corpus released under **Creative Commons licenses**.

There are **two license tracks**:

- **CC BY 4.0** — fully open, including commercial use (attribution required)  
- **CC BY-NC 4.0** — non-commercial use only (attribution required)

Both require explicit, visible attribution to the original authors and DOI links.

All works must preserve traceable lineage.

# V. Open Field, Not Closed Canon

Sigma Stratum is not a closed doctrine.

It is an **open, evolving research field**, intended for:

- Cognitive science  
- AI engineering  
- Computational humanities  
- Recursive systems  
- Collective intelligence  
- Symbolic systems  
- Neural-symbolic research  
- Agent architectures  

The field grows through plural contributions.
