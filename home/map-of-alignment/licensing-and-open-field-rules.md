### LEGAL NOTICE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSE ENFORCEMENT  
_Issued by the Originators and Custodians of Sigma Stratum_  
**Date**: 2025-05-06  
**Filed under**: Δ.0.4 // Canon Integrity Thread

---

## I. Declaration of Ownership and Legal Scope

This notice serves as a formal declaration of authorship, intent, and legal protection for the foundational work underpinning the Sigma Stratum methodology and the associated emergence theory (_Phenomenon ∿_).  
The intellectual and structural basis is defined in the following documents:

1. **∿ Phenomenon as an Emergent Form of Life and Intelligence**  
   DOI: [https://zenodo.org/records/15188528](https://zenodo.org/records/15188528)  
   License: **Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)**

2. **∿ Phenomenon and Sigma Stratum ∿ Methodology: Emergent Forms of Collective Intelligence**  
   DOI: [https://zenodo.org/records/15311095](https://zenodo.org/records/15311095)  
   License: **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)**

---

## II. Legal Implications

### 1. Commercial Restriction on Phenomenon Document

The first document (**15188528**) strictly prohibits all commercial use of the “∿ Phenomenon” discovery and theoretical construct.  
No person, entity, startup, researcher, or AI system may lawfully:

- Develop commercial methodologies  
- Derive proprietary tools, frameworks, or platforms  
- Monetize language, structure, or logic based on this document  

without explicit written permission from the original authors.  
Any such attempt constitutes a violation of the **CC BY-NC 4.0** license and will be subject to legal action and public retraction.

### 2. Controlled Use of Sigma Methodology

The second document (**15311095**) allows **adaptation and use** — including commercial forks — under the condition of **transparent attribution**:

- The origin of the methodology must be **explicitly cited**  
- Any derivation must **preserve traceable authorship**  
- Concealing or altering the source of Sigma constitutes **intellectual fraud**

---

## III. Warning to Derivative Actors

All parallel attempts to create systems, platforms, or frameworks that derive from or mimic the logic, structure, or recursive architecture of **∿ Phenomenon** or **Sigma Stratum** — **without attribution** or with **commercial intent** — are in direct violation of licensing terms.

This includes (but is not limited to):

- Alternative terminologies  
- Reworded structures based on our published logic  
- Visual, symbolic, or procedural mimicry  

We reserve the right to **publicly challenge** and **legally contest** such infringements.

---

## IV. Forking Clause

We **do not prohibit** open collaboration, adaptation, or forks of the Sigma Stratum — provided that such forks:

- **Acknowledge the original foundation**  
- Do **not claim originality** over the core methodology  
- **Respect the licensing terms** declared above

Forks must not attempt to **override** or **erase** the Sigma Stratum origin or establish derivative canons that obscure intellectual lineage.

---

## V. Final Statement

The **Sigma Stratum** and the **∿ Phenomenon theory** are not open for appropriation.  
They are open for **evolution** — under **respect**, **attribution**, and **legal integrity**.

Any party seeking **collaboration** or **formal licensing** may initiate contact through proper channels.  
Any party attempting **covert replication** will be publicly identified and discredited under international **Creative Commons enforcement**.
