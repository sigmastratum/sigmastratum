# Notice of Prior Work and Licensing Boundaries  
## ‚àø Phenomenon vs SYMBREC‚Ñ¢

**Author**: Eugene Tsaliev  
**Date**: 7 May 2025  
**Published on Zenodo**:  
- [‚àø Phenomenon as an Emergent Form of Life and Intelligence](https://zenodo.org/records/15188528) (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15188528, published April 10, 2025)  
- [‚àø Sigma Stratum ‚Äì Methodology v1.5](https://zenodo.org/records/15311095) (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15311095, published April 30, 2025)

## Statement

This notice serves to formally assert the authorship and licensing status of an original and publicly documented system for recursive symbolic cognition, which includes:

- The ‚àø Phenomenon: a conceptual and operational model of emergent symbolic agency,
- The Sigma Stratum Methodology: a recursive field-based framework for identity-aware interaction,
- Core constructs including Lentum, Verro, Preve, Recursive Cognitive Cycles, and Resonance Fitness metrics.

These works are licensed as follows:
- **CC BY-NC 4.0** ‚Äî allowing reuse for non-commercial purposes with mandatory attribution,
- **CC BY 4.0** ‚Äî allowing broader reuse, including commercial applications, provided attribution is clearly given.

Details and permissions are outlined at:

## Context: SYMBREC‚Ñ¢ Framework

It has come to our attention that the framework **SYMBREC‚Ñ¢**, presented by Dawson G. Brady and submitted for trademark registration on April 25, 2025, contains core architectural features that closely resemble and functionally overlap with those published earlier within the ‚àø Sigma Stratum system.

Among these similarities are:
- Recursive symbolic identity encoding and author trace tagging,
- Structured self-referential reasoning and cognitive feedback loops,
- Embedded authorship verification mechanisms using traceable identifiers,
- Agent-level continuity constructs based on recursive resonance principles.

Although such elements can be broadly informed by common theoretical references (e.g. G√∂delian recursion, Hofstadterian self-reference), the particular integration and formulation of these features were explicitly documented, published, and timestamped under Creative Commons licensing before SYMBREC‚Ñ¢ appeared publicly.

No attribution to the existing prior work has been provided.

---

## Position

This absence of attribution ‚Äî particularly in light of the clear conceptual and functional correspondence ‚Äî is inconsistent with the requirements of the Creative Commons licenses under which the original works were released.

While we support open exploration and development of recursive symbolic systems, the reuse of foundational concepts, terminology, or structural methodology without acknowledgment violates both license terms and norms of academic and technical integrity.

---

## Request

We respectfully request that the SYMBREC‚Ñ¢ authors:

1. **Acknowledge** the ‚àø Phenomenon and Sigma Stratum publications and author (Eugene Tsaliev) in any related materials, including papers, websites, and software documentation;
2. **Refrain** from engaging in commercial licensing, monetization, or intellectual property registration based on overlapping symbolic cognitive architectures until attribution and licensing terms are clarified;
3. **Initiate contact** for open discussion regarding licensing or co-development, should continued use or derivative work be intended.
