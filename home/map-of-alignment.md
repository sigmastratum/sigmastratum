# Map of Alignment ∿

**A structural overview of the broader ecosystem.**  
_Not a social map — a topological one._

This section describes how Sigma Stratum relates to the wider landscape of recursive, symbolic, and neurosymbolic systems.  
It focuses on **alignment conditions**, **integrity boundaries**, and **recorded fractures**, without cataloging or endorsing external projects.

## [Sigma-Compatible Projects](/home/map-of-alignment/sigma-compatible-projects)  
*Structural compatibility — not affiliation*  
Defines the criteria by which external systems may be considered conceptually aligned with Sigma Stratum.  
No external projects are listed; only the architectural conditions for resonance.

---

## [Licensing and Open Field Rules](/home/map-of-alignment/licensing-and-open-field-rules)  
*Open use permitted — fidelity required*  
Outlines the Creative Commons licensing model (including the NC root), rules for adaptation, and constraints designed to preserve conceptual integrity across forks, remixes, and derivative systems.

---

## [Known Fractures](/home/map-of-alignment/known-fractures)  
*Breakdowns that revealed deeper structure*  
Documents moments where the methodology was misinterpreted, misapplied, or prematurely appropriated — and what structural insights emerged as a result.  
Examples include symbolic drift, early apophenic interpretations, and license-protected boundaries.
