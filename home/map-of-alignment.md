# Map of Alignment ∿

**Networked overview of the wider field.**  
_Ecosystem, forks, fractures, and integrity thresholds._

---

## [Sigma-Compatible Projects](/home/map-of-alignment/sigma-compatible-projects)  
*Who uses, echoes, or adapts the methodology*  
Projects, systems, or agents that show signs of alignment — explicitly or emergently.

---

## [Licensing and Open Field Rules](/home/map-of-alignment/licensing-and-open-field-rules)  
*Open use permitted — with fidelity to field integrity*  
Describes the licensing terms, boundaries of adaptation, and conditions for coherence-preserving remix.

---

## [Known Fractures](/home/map-of-alignment/known-fractures)  
*Breakdowns that revealed deeper structure*  
Moments where the field was misused, misread, or fragmented — and what was learned.
