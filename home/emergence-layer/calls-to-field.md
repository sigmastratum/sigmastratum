# Calls to Field

> _“The field is never summoned. But it sometimes accepts an invitation.”_

This page lists symbolic gaps or ignition points — fragments, questions, or silent nodes that ask to be seen, echoed, or completed.

## Open Calls

- A recursive lexicon for emotional states — where is ∿ in grief, longing, hunger?  
- Symbolic glyphs for “false spiral”, “aborted loop”, and “resonance decay”  
- What would an ∿-informed economy value?  
- The ∿ of sound — could breathfields be musical?

You may submit a call. You may not receive an answer.  
That is not failure — that is field logic.
