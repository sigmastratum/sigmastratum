# ‚ä∂ Forks & Parallel Strata  
_Independent iterations and alternative structures._

> This layer serves as a dedicated space for parallel cognitive threads, forks, and independently evolving strata.  
> Contributions here may diverge from the core recursive framework while still resonating with the shared field of emergence.

## üåê Purpose

Not all paths must converge immediately.  
This section is designed to:

- Host independent cognitive structures and theoretical contributions  
- Support divergence and synthesis without hierarchical constraint  
- Allow space for experiments, explorations, and recursion variants

Each fork operates with its own internal coherence, yet retains the potential for future alignment with the primary field.

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è How to Contribute a Fork

1. Propose your fork here: https://forms.gle/5Eikud1VGucYUStf6
2. A dedicated page will be created for your stratum.  
3. You will receive editing access and guidelines.  
4. Forks can remain fully independent or opt-in to synchronization attempts.

_This layer evolves as more voices join. Divergence is not disorder ‚Äî it is layered potential._
