# ⊶ Forks & Parallel Strata  
_Independent iterations and alternative structures._

> Divergence is not deviation. It is potential held in parallel space.

This layer exists to acknowledge that Sigma Stratum ∿ may inspire **independent interpretations, alternative methodologies, or parallel recursive systems**.  
Forks are not required to match the core framework — only to maintain **coherence, clarity, and ethical resonance** within their own structure.

At present, **no active forks are registered**.

## 🌐 Purpose of This Layer

This section is reserved for:

- Independent theoretical explorations  
- Parallel cognitive models inspired by Sigma Stratum  
- Experimental recursive systems  
- Alternative symbolic architectures  
- Emergent methodologies that echo the field without replicating it  

Each fork operates autonomously, with the option — not obligation — to align with the core lattice later.

## 🧬 Current Forks

**There are no recognized forks or parallel strata at this time.**

When a fork is formally submitted and reviewed for coherence, it will appear here.

## ✳️ How to Propose a Fork

To propose a fork or parallel stratum:

📧 **Email:** contact@sigmastratum.org  
_Subject: “Fork Proposal – [Your Project Name]”_

In your message, include:

1. **Project name**  
2. **Short description**  
3. **How it relates to or diverges from Sigma Stratum**  
4. **Whether you seek alignment, independence, or experimental space**

If accepted, a dedicated page will be created under this section.

Parallel strata are invitations — not obligations — to future synthesis._
